The purpose of this research is to estimate the occurrence, and to investigate the presence of PTSD symptoms in military police officers of the state of Bahia. In order to collaborate understanding the mental health of these professionals, showing the sociodemographic profile of this population. Methodology: The sample consisted of 228 military police officers who filled out the sociodemographic form, and the for related with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-civilis, a self-assessment scale based on DSM-IV, to track this disorder. This research was approved by the Ethics Committee in Research Institute for Higher Education in Bahia (CEP / IMES) of the Foundation for the Promotion of Technology and Science - FTC Foundation. Results: According to the criteria of cut-off point, 35.53% of the participants presented symptoms of PTSD, and 16.7% was the estimated rate of PTSD according to the group criteria. There was not statistical association of socio-demographic items with the presence of PTSD. Relating with clinical history variable, the only one that had significant statistical difference was the history of psychiatric illness (p = 0.019). In terms of symptomatology, 50.4% of all participants fulfilled the criteria for increased excitability, 40.3% for trauma revival, and 23.2% for avoidance and emotional numbness. Discussion: The majority of probable PTSD in police officers are high and consistent with the data. Despite the limitations caused by the use of a single collection instrument, which made it impossible to evaluate the frequency and type of traumatic event, the objectives were reached. CONCLUSIONS: The high estimate of PTSD found comparing to general population may contribute to develop effectiveness policies aimed at the prevention and treatment of PTSD in military police. As a result, any association was not identified between the presence of the disorder and the sociodemographic data analyzed.; ID: 17046']",Revista Brasileira de Neurologia e Psiquiatria,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L621320508&from=export,Journal Article,"['article', 'Bahia', 'DSM-IV', 'human', 'major clinical study', 'police', 'posttraumatic stress disorder', 'self evaluation']",1414-0365,,English Portuguese,187,216,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,
