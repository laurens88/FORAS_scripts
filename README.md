# Merge script

## Introduction
This script can be used to merge scientific paper datasets of `.csv` format whilst keeping track of where duplicates originate from. Besides a merged output file, the script also produces a copy of the subset of papers which do not have an abstract, and a `.xlsx` file describing the number of unique records from each input set and the number of records found for every combination of input sets.

## Features
- **Data Merging:** Combines multiple datasets into a single file.
- **Source Column Filling:** Marks the source file for each data entry.
- **Duplicate Removal:** Identifies and removes duplicate entries based on titles, abstracts, and DOIs.
- **Annotation File Creation:** Generates files for missing abstracts with columns for annotator judgments.
- **Statistics Generation:** Outputs statistics about the input and merged datasets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `argparse`, `warnings`, `pathlib`, `re`, `sys`
- ASReview (`asreview`) for handling systematic review data

## Installation
Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed and the required libraries. You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib argparse asreview
```

## Usage
To use the script, you must have Python installed on your system. The script is executed from the command line with the output file name and the list of input files as arguments.

### Command Line Syntax
```bash
python foras_project.py <output_file> <input_file1> <input_file2> ... <input_fileN>
```

### Example
```bash
python foras_project.py merged_output.csv dataset1.csv dataset2.csv dataset3.csv
```

This command merges `dataset1.csv`, `dataset2.csv`, and `dataset3.csv` into a new file named `merged_output.csv`.

# Preprocess script

## Introduction
The FORAS Project preprocessing script is designed for cleaning and standardizing datasets before they are used for systematic reviews or data analysis. This script focuses on generalizing column names, cleaning data, and preparing datasets for further processing. It supports CSV input files and outputs the processed data to a specified CSV file.

## Features
- **Column Generalization:** Renames columns to standard names for titles, years, and DOIs.
- **Label Preparation:** Prepares the label column by renaming and cleaning values.
- **DOI Cleaning:** Cleans and standardizes DOI column values.
- **Column Cleaning:** Removes unnecessary columns from the dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `argparse`, `warnings`, `pathlib`, `sys`, `re`
- ASReview (`asreview`) for handling systematic review data configurations

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy argparse asreview
```

## Usage
This script is executed from the command line, taking the input file name and the output file name as arguments.

### Command Line Syntax
```bash
python preprocess_script.py <input_file.csv> <output_file.csv>
```

### Example
```bash
python preprocess_script.py dataset.csv cleaned_dataset.csv
```

This command will preprocess `dataset.csv` and save the cleaned and standardized data to `cleaned_dataset.csv`.

## Function Descriptions
- `preprocess(file, output_file)`: Main function for preprocessing the input CSV file.
- `clean_columns(dataframe)`: Removes unnecessary columns from the dataframe.
- `generalize_title_column(dataframe)`: Standardizes the column name for titles.
- `generalize_year_column(dataframe)`: Standardizes the column name for years.
- `generalize_doi_column(dataframe)`: Standardizes the column name for DOIs.
- `prepare_label_column(dataframe)`: Prepares the label column by renaming and cleaning.
- `clean_doi_column(dataframe)`: Cleans DOI column values.
- `main()`: Entry point of the script.

### Before Preprocessing
The original dataset (`dataset.csv`) might have entries with varying column names, missing data, and unstandardized formats. For example:

| Title                        | Pub Year | record DOI           | Included | Unnamed: 4 |
|------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|----------|------------|
| Sample Research Article      | 2020     | https://doi.org/10.1000/journal.2020 | 1        | NaN        |
| Another Research Article     | 2019     | 10.1001/journal.2019                 | -1       | NaN        |

- Column names are inconsistent (e.g., "Pub Year" instead of "year").
- The DOI column includes prefixes and is not lowercase.
- The "Included" column contains `-1` for indicating exclusion, which is not standard.
- There is an unnecessary column ("Unnamed: 4").

### After Preprocessing
After running `python preprocess_script.py dataset.csv cleaned_dataset.csv`, the dataset is cleaned and standardized:

| title                      | year | doi                 | included_dataset.csv | 
|----------------------------|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Sample Research Article    | 2020 | 10.1000/journal.2020| 1                     |
| Another Research Article   | 2019 | 10.1001/journal.2019|                       |

- Column names are standardized to "title", "year", "doi", and "included_dataset.csv" to reflect the source file and inclusion status.
- The DOI is cleaned to remove the URL prefix and is all lowercase.
- The "Included" column is renamed to "included_dataset.csv" and `-1` values are replaced with blanks to indicate exclusion more clearly.
- Unnecessary columns are removed.

This example demonstrates how the preprocessing script standardizes dataset entries, making them cleaner and more consistent for subsequent analysis or systematic review processes.

## Output File
- **Processed Dataset:** A CSV file containing the preprocessed dataset with standardized column names and cleaned data.

# Insert labels script

## Introduction
The FORAS Project Insert Labels script is designed to integrate annotations from annotator-specific files back into the main dataset, referred to as the "motherfile". This process is crucial for consolidating annotated data, facilitating analysis, and ensuring that all annotations are accurately reflected in the central dataset. The script matches records based on a unique identifier (MID), then inserts the corresponding labels and batch information from the annotation file into the motherfile.

## Features
- **Label Column Integration:** Adds empty label columns to the motherfile based on names from the annotation file.
- **Record Matching:** Identifies matching records between the annotation file and the motherfile using the MID.
- **Label Insertion:** Inserts label values and batch information from the annotation file into the corresponding records in the motherfile.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sys`, `re`
- ASReview (`asreview`) for handling systematic review data configurations

## Installation
Ensure Python and the necessary libraries are installed on your system. You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy asreview
```

## Usage
This script is executed from the command line, taking the motherfile name, the annotation file name, and the batch identifier as arguments.

### Command Line Syntax
```bash
python insert_labels_script.py <motherfile.csv> <annotation_file.xlsx> <batch>
```

### Example
```bash
python insert_labels_script.py dataset.csv JohnDoe_annotations.xlsx Batch1
```

This command will process `JohnDoe_annotations.xlsx`, matching its records with those in `dataset.csv` based on MID, and insert the annotations along with the batch identifier (Batch1) into the motherfile.

## Function Descriptions
- `insert(motherfile, annotation_file, batch)`: Main function to insert label values from the annotation file into the motherfile.
- `add_label_columns(mother_df, annotation_df)`: Adds empty label columns to the motherfile based on the annotation file.
- `set_label_values(mother_frame, annotation_frame, mother_index, annotation_index, columns, batch)`: Inserts label values and batch information into the motherfile.
- `records_match(df1, df2, index1, index2)`: Checks if records in two dataframes match based on MID.
- `main()`: Entry point of the script, parsing command line arguments and initiating the label insertion process.

## Output File
- **Updated Motherfile:** The script outputs an updated version of the motherfile with added labels from the annotation file and batch information. The file is saved with a "+labels.csv" suffix to denote that labels have been inserted.

## Note
